## Getting Started

**Color Game**

Instructions:

You will be given a random color in RGB format at the start of the game.
There are two game modes. On Easy mode, you will be shown three colored squares on the page; on Hard mode, you will be shown six colored squares on the page.

From the RGB values given at the top of the screen, figure out which color is correct by clicking on the colored squares. Each clicked square will disappear. If you make an incorrect guess, you will see the words "Try Again!"

You win the game by matching your guess to the random RGB color at the top. All squares come back and both the top of the screen and all squares change to the same as the winning color.

The RGB value at the top of the screen resets when you click "Play Again?".
